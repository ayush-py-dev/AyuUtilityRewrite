# Ayu's Utilities

A discord Bot made for the private server of youtuber/software developer: **Ayu Itz**

This bot is open source and you can ~~steal~~ use the codes without any second thought. (Just don't forget to give credits :D )

If you need any help or having some trouble to run the bot, feel free to join my discord to get help.

## How to run

**I highly recommend to use a virtual envoirnment so not to mess up with your installed packages**

> fill up your config.py file

> run main.py file
#### For Widnows:
(use `python`)
```sh
python main.py
```
#### For Linux:
(use `python3`)
```sh
python3 main.py
```
